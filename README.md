# Last Value Display

This project displays the last command entered into the database for robot control.

## Description

The project consists of a web page that allows you to control a robot by sending movement commands (forward, backward, left, right, stop) to a database. Another page displays the last command entered into the database.

## Project Structure

- index.html: The main HTML file for the control panel interface.
- control.php: The PHP script to handle commands from the control panel and store them in the database.
- last_value.php: The PHP script to display the last command entered into the database.
- style.css: The CSS file for styling the control panel interface.

## Usage

1. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost/robot_control_with_last_value/index.html.
2. Use the buttons on the control panel to send movement commands to the robot.
3. Open another tab and navigate to http://localhost/robot_control_with_last_value/last_value.php to see the last command entered.
